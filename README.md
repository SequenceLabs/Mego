SEQUENCE MIDDLEMAN TEMPLATE
=================

This is a work in progress for a rapid HTML prototyping framework, using MiddleMan, HAML and SASS.

Currently its being trialed on various internal projects.

Feel free to use any of the work, but this is not external production-ready code, so use at your own risk. :)
